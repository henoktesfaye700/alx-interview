    The positions are represented by a list of indices in the
    range [0, N) where the index represents the row and the value
    at that index represents the column.

    The positions are found by using a recursive backtracking
    algorithm. The positions are yielded from the recursive function
    as they are found.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The size of the board. Must be at least 4.
    i (int): The current row. Defaults to 0.
    a (list): The list of column indices for the queens in the
        rows above the current row. Defaults to an empty list.
    b (list): The list of column indices plus row indices for the
        queens in the rows above the current row. Defaults to an
        empty list.
    c (list): The list of column indices minus row indices for the
        queens in the rows above the current row. Defaults to an
        empty list.

    Yields:
    list: The list of column indices for the N queens.
